- Office hour with the lecturer: after each lecture or upon arrangement.
- Office hour with the TAs: Monday 17h-18h, Room 307 at KRAFTON x SoC building.
  

  
- Schedule: 
  - Lecture Schedule. Monday and Wednesday, 09:00-10:30.
  - All lectures will take place on-site.
  - No lecture during the week of 6-10 Oct (Korean Thanksgiving Holiday) and on 19th November.
     
- Grading: Homeworks, Participation, Quiz 30%, Midterm exam 35%, Final exam 35%
  
 
- Course policy:
  - The official language in the class is English. 
  - Homework assignments will be announced on KLMS. Expect an assignment at least every two weeks. Ideally, the solutions to homeworks should be written in English, either in LaTeX / in a text editor, e.g. MS Word / or VERY CLEAN AND IMMEDIATELY READABLE handwriting. People who grade your homework will NOT spend time struggling to decipher your handwriting. No matter how great your solution is, if it's not readable EASILY, it gets exactly that much score. The assignment needs to be submitted before the indicated deadline on KLMS. 
  - A strict policy against dishonest behaviors will be applied; expect an "F" grade and be reported to the SoC board when you fail to follow the [honor code](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=309).
  - No retake of the course will be allowed regardless of your grade.
  - Class attendance is not taken into account for the grade.


Course Description
-------------------
We study ‘computer science’ and a computer is a computing machine. In this course, we study various notions and ideas which were developed since 1930’s in response to fundamental questions such as the following. 
- What do we mean by computing? 
- What is the object that a computing machine computes? Why do we call a programming language a ‘language’?
- Both computer scientists and linguists talk about ‘languages’. Is there something in common? How to formalize the link between them?
- Computers ranging from high-performance servers, desktops, laptops to mobile phones, from a wide range of manufacturers are all ‘computers’. On which ground, do we treat them as if they are (essentially) equally powerful machines which are all called computers?
- Is there a problem which cannot be ‘computed’? How to tell if a problem is computable or not?
- Is there a problem we’d better give up finding an ‘efficient’ algorithm? How to tell if a problem is efficiently computable or not?
- Is the computer implemented as your iMac the only form of a computer? 

Recommended Prerequisite
- We assume that you have attended Discrete Mathematics (CS204) or have a sufficient background knowledge covered in similar courses. Introduction to Algorithms (CS300) is a plus. 
- To be successful in this course, you need certain, if not high, level of mathematical maturity. For example, competence in writing a formal proof and digesting abstract concepts in mathematical formalism are needed. 
We also assume that you have a moderate experience in programming, even though we do not do coding during the class.
